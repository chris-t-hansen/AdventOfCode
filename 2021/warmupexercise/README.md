# Advent of Code 2021 Warmup Exercise 
My office runs an Advent of Code competition each year. This year, they posted a warmup exercise to get everyone excited.

## Example Problem
Each line of input is a non-negative integer. Find the solution by subtracting the sum of the even numbers from the sum of the odd numbers.
For example, if the input was:

4118  
2666  
7528  
3301  
3856  
2756  
4864  
3857  
6329  
8776  

The correct solution would be -21077.

## My Solutions
My first programming language as a kid was GW-BASIC. I was feeling a bit nostalgic so I wrote a solution in [Yabasic](http://2484.de/yabasic/) which I have installed on a cheap [Orange Pi Zero](http://www.orangepi.org/orangepizero/).  
I have always wanted to try out LOLCODE and since this was a relatively simple puzzle, I thought this would be a fun one to try. It is not the most efficient code in the world, but I wanted to try some of the different features like making a function and switch statements. I put in a ton of comments for anyone interested (and to remind myself of what I did because there's no way I'll remember this syntz). The solution requires version [LOLCODE 1.4](https://lolcodepp.github.io/) to run. I also set that up on my Orange Pi Zero - which is slowly becoming a reposibtory of lesser used programming languages.

## Example Input Files
I've included the input files for anyone who would like to try out their own solution.
